    <p>Trojans, or a Trojan Horse Virus, is a type of malware that infects your computer through clicking on links disguised to be something else. It’s called a Trojan due to its resemblance to the famous Greek epic in which during a war against Troy, the Greek army built a large wooden horse and gave it as a gift to their enemies, but what the trojans didn’t know was that inside the horse were several Greek soldiers which under the cover of night, opened the gate and promptly destroyed the city.  </p>
