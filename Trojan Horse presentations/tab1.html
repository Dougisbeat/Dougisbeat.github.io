    <h2>Types of Troajans</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Arc Bombs </h4><p>These trojans will get into your system and either freeze or very seriously slow the system. corrupt data that lead to a malfunction of an archiver or an unpacking algorithm </p></li>
      <li><h4>Backdoors</h4><p>These will allow the hacker to control your computer remotely. receiving, sending, deleting or launching files; displaying screen alerts; or rebooting PCs. </p></li>
      <li><h4>Banking Trojans</h4><p>These are created to steal confidential user data such as login credentials, passwords, SMS authentication, or bank card info.</p></li>
      <li><h4>Clickers</h4><p>These Trojans are created to access internet sites and servers. Users are not aware of such activity as clickers send commands to browsers. Clickers may also replace Windows host files where standard addresses are indicated. </p></li>
      <li><h4>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</h4><p>DDoS Trojans are intended to launch denial of service attacks targeting the victim’s IP address. During such attacks, a flood of requests get sent from multiple infected devices to the DDoS victim thus overloading it and causing it to stop functioning. </p></li>
      <li><h4>Downloader Trojan</h4><p> Downloaders can download and launch malicious software, including other Trojans. Data about the location and name of the programs that need to be downloaded is stored inside the Trojan code or can be obtained by the Trojan from the server controlled by the Trojan author. Downloaders are frequently used to get the initial foothold on the system. Innocent users visit infected webpages that contain exploits. These exploits deliver downloaders that then download the rest of the malicious payload.  </p></li>
      <li><h4>Droppers</h4><p>These software pieces are designed to install malware covertly. They contain other malware that is obfuscated and deeply hidden inside the dropper's code. This is done to prevent detection by antivirus software. Many antivirus tools cannot analyze all components of droppers. They usually are saved to a Windows temporary directory. Then they are executed without any user notifications. </p></li>
      <li><h4>FakeAV</h4><p>Malicious software like fakeAV impersonates the operation of antivirus tools. Fake AV shows numerous security warnings to users trying to extort money from them. Inexperienced users get frightened and buy full versions of fakeAVs to get rid of the non-existent security threats. </p></li>
      <li><h4>Game Thieves</h4><p>Similar to bankers, game thieves are intended to steal confidential information. Instead of stealing financial records, game thieves steal information related to online gaming accounts. These Trojans then use email, FTP and other data transfer methods to pass stolen info to hackers.</p></li>
      <li><h4>Instant Messaging Trojans</h4><p>IM Trojans steal logins and passwords used to access instant messaging services like Skype or WhatsApp. Trojans then pass this data to attackers via email, web requests, FTP and other methods.  </p></li>
      <li><h4>Loaders</h4><p>A Loader is a small piece of code needed to install the full version of the virus. A tiny loader enters the computer system (for example, when the user is viewing a malicious image file). During this process, the loader connects to a server and downloads and installs the rest of its components. </p></li>
      <li><h4>Mail Finders</h4><p>Mailfinders steal email addresses from user computers and transmit them to hackers. Criminals then use the collected addresses for spamming and phishing attacks. </p></li>
      <li><h4>Notifiers</h4><p>This type of Trojans sends its developer information about the infected computer and its status. It may include info on open ports, launched software, and running services. Notifiers are used during complex attacks involving multi-component malware. Attackers need to be sure all parts of their malware are successfully installed.  </p></li>
      <li><h4>Proxies</h4><p>These Trojans allow attackers to get anonymous access to internet websites using the victim’s computer as an intermediary. Crooks use this type of viruses to send spam while hiding behind victims’ IP addresses.  </p></li>
      <li><h4>Password Stealing Ware (PSW)</h4><p>Password Stealing Ware steals passwords from infected computers. Trojans of this type can search for passwords kept by users inside files or by web browsers. Some variants may steal software licenses and system/network passwords. </p></li>
      <li><h4>Ransom Trojans</h4><p> Ransom Trojans may encrypt files andor block access to a PC, so users are unable to use it. Attackers offer victims to pay the ransom in exchange for their data or restoring the regular operation of the device. These Trojans are extremely popular now. Some operators earn millions of dollars in short periods of time. </p></li>
      <li><h4>Short Messaging System (SMS) Trojans</h4><p>These rogue programs send SMS messages from infected devices (smartphones) to premium-rate numbers. Sometimes, they can be used as SMS interceptors during multi-stage attacks involving two-factor authentication. </p></li>
