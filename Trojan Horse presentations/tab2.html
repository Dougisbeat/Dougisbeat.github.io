    <h2>Famous Instances</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Zeus</h4><p>Zeus is considered one of the most dangerous computer viruses because it breached about 88% of all Fortune 500 companies. It also cost $3 billion in total damages and was responsible for about 44% of all banking malware attacks in 2007, the year it was created. 
        The virus was a group of programs that took over machines remotely. It sent out phishing emails and used malicious downloads to infect new hosts. Once the user clicked on the attachments or links, the virus installed the Zeus malware package. 
        The Zeus virus is particularly nasty because it can steal your sensitive data, such as banking information. (It’s also known as a banking Trojan horse.) The other way it works is by remotely contacting the hacker so they can hijack your computer and install more malware. </p></li>

      <li><h4>Cryptolocker</h4><p>Yet another notorious virus that targets the Windows operating system, Cryptolocker is a Trojan horse that encrypts files on your device and any connected media. Once it strikes, victims see a countdown timer and a warning that their files have been encrypted. 

        Although many antivirus programs were able to remove the Trojan, they couldn’t decrypt data. This forced several victims to reinstall Cryptolocker in order to pay the ransom for their data. This highlights the importance of maintaining a digital backup of any critical files you may have on your computer. </p></li>
