    <h2>What are the Ethics?</h2>
    <p>Trojan horses are malware that most people use for evil doing since they allow people unrestricted access to someoneâ€™s computer. Most of the time they are not good, but there are sometimes when they are good, for instance they could be used to spy on and destroy the computers of people that are very bad such as terrorists, scammers, or black-hat hackers. Most of the time they are used for making money out of vulnerable people rather it be using their computer to mine crypto currency or by holding their computer or their data for ransom until they pay to get it back.  </p>
